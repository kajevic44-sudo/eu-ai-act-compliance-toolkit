# Toolkit Index: Coverage Map

A single at-a-glance map of every document, the EU AI Act provisions it covers,

role-based walkthrough, see the **"Which Documents Apply to Me?"** table in the
main [README](../README.md).

## Lifecycle stages

- **Screen:** rule out prohibited practices and establish your position before anything else (Docs 25, 19).
- **Classify:** determine risk tier and role (Docs 01, 10).
- **Build:** implement the controls a high-risk system needs before placement (Docs 03, 04, 07, 16, 26, etc.).
- **Place on market:** conformity, declaration, CE marking, supply-chain steps (Docs 02, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 23).
- **Operate:** ongoing monitoring, incidents, registration, enforcement readiness (Docs 05, 06, 08, 09, 22, 28).
- **Reference:** worked examples and supporting material.
