# 23: Annex VII Assessment Criteria Checklist

**EU AI Act Reference:** Annex VII | Article 43 | Article 44
**Applies to:** Providers of high-risk AI systems requiring Notified Body (NB) assessment; internal conformity teams preparing documentation packages
**Last Updated:** April 2026

## Purpose

Annex VII of the EU AI Act sets out the technical requirements for the conformity assessment procedure based on assessment of the quality management system and assessment of the technical documentation. This checklist maps what a Notified Body (NB) will review against specific Article requirements, enabling providers to:

- Self-assess readiness before engaging an NB
- Prepare complete documentation packages
- Anticipate NB findings and pre-emptively remediate gaps
- Understand the evidence standard required for each requirement

This checklist is organised to mirror the NB's assessment sequence: QMS assessment first, then technical documentation assessment.

> **Note:** This checklist reflects the Annex VII structure as enacted in Regulation (EU) 2024/1689. The EU AI Act does not prescribe specific test methods or harmonised standards for all requirements; where standards are absent, NBs apply general conformity assessment methodology. As harmonised standards are published under the AI Act, update this checklist accordingly.

## Part 1: Phase 1: Quality Management System Assessment

Under Annex VII, the NB first assesses the provider's QMS to determine whether it adequately ensures compliance with applicable requirements.

### 1.1 QMS Documentation Review

The NB will review the QMS documentation to verify it covers all Article 17(1)(a)-(g) requirements.
