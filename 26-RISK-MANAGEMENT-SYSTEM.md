# 26: Article 9 Risk Management System Template
## EU AI Act Compliance Toolkit | v3.2.0 | April 2026
### Regulatory Reference: Article 9 | Applicable to: All High-Risk AI Systems (Article 6 + Annex I/III)

---

## Purpose and Scope

This document is a **standalone Risk Management System (RMS) template** for high-risk AI systems under Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689. The RMS is a **mandatory, continuous, iterative process** that must be established, implemented, documented, and maintained throughout the entire lifecycle of the system, from design through decommissioning.

**Critical distinction from the Quality Management System (Doc 16):** The QMS (Article 17) governs organisational processes and procedures. The RMS (Article 9) governs system-level risk identification, estimation, evaluation, and mitigation. Both are required. Both must be documented separately for Notified Body review.

**Article 9 obligations apply to:** Providers of high-risk AI systems listed in Annex III or embedded in regulated products (Annex I).

**This template is distinct from:**
- Doc 02: Conformity Assessment Checklist (covers all conformity obligations, not just risk management)
- Doc 03: FRIA (focuses on fundamental rights, not technical risks)
- Doc 04: Technical Documentation (Annex IV, RMS evidence is submitted as part of technical docs)
- Doc 09: Post-Market Monitoring Plan (ongoing monitoring feeds into the RMS but is a separate obligation)

---

## RMS Overview: The Article 9 Cycle

Article 9 requires a risk management process consisting of the following steps, which must operate as a continuous loop throughout the system lifecycle:

```
[1. Establish RMS] → [2. Identify Known/Foreseeable Risks] → [3. Estimate Risk Magnitude]
        ↑                                                               ↓
[8. Update RMS]  ←  [7. Review Post-Market Data]  ←  [4. Evaluate Against Thresholds]
                                                               ↓
                                        [5. Risk Treatment / Mitigation Measures]
                                                               ↓
                                        [6. Residual Risk Assessment & Acceptance]
```

All steps must be documented. The RMS record forms part of the technical documentation under Annex IV.

### 2.1 Intended Use Risk Identification

For each risk category below, document identified risks specific to this system:

#### Category A: Technical Performance Risks

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Trigger Scenario | Affected Persons |
|---|---|---|---|

## Part 3: Step 2: Risk Estimation

**Article 9(2)(b)** requires estimation of the severity and likelihood of each identified risk, informed by the nature of the AI system, the severity of potential harm, the number of persons potentially affected, and the reversibility of harm.

### 3.1 Risk Estimation Criteria

**Likelihood Scale:**

| Level | Score | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| Rare | 1 | Event could occur only in exceptional circumstances |
| Unlikely | 2 | Event could occur at some time in the system's operational life |
| Possible | 3 | Event might occur in some circumstances |
| Likely | 4 | Event will probably occur in most circumstances |
| Almost Certain | 5 | Event is expected to occur in most deployments |

**Severity Scale (per affected individual):**

| Level | Score | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| Negligible | 1 | Minor inconvenience; easily reversible; no lasting impact |
| Minor | 2 | Limited harm; reversible with moderate effort; limited rights impact |
| Moderate | 3 | Significant harm; partially reversible; material rights impact |
| Major | 4 | Serious harm; difficult to reverse; significant rights impact (e.g., denied employment, restricted access to credit) |
| Critical | 5 | Catastrophic harm; irreversible; severe rights violation (e.g., wrongful detention, serious bodily harm) |

**Breadth Scale (number of affected persons):**

| Level | Score | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| Individual | 1 | Affects 1-10 persons in isolated incidents |
| Small Group | 2 | Affects 10-100 persons or a specific subgroup |
| Limited | 3 | Affects 100-10,000 persons |
| Large | 4 | Affects 10,000-1,000,000 persons |
| Widespread | 5 | Affects over 1,000,000 persons or a protected group systemically |

**Risk Score = Likelihood x Severity**
**Risk Priority Score = Likelihood x Severity x Breadth**

### 3.2 Risk Register

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Likelihood (1-5) | Severity (1-5) | Breadth (1-5) | Risk Score (LxS) | Priority Score (LxSxB) | Inherent Risk Level | Treatment Required |

**Risk Level thresholds:**
- **Low:** Score 1-4
- **Medium:** Score 5-9
- **High:** Score 10-16
- **Critical:** Score 17-25

---

## Part 4: Step 3: Risk Evaluation Against Acceptable Thresholds

**Article 9(4)** requires that the risk management measures result in residual risks being judged acceptable, considering the generally acknowledged state of the art and the specific benefits of the AI system.

### 4.1 Acceptable Risk Threshold Policy

| Risk Level | Default Treatment Policy | Approval Required |
|---|---|---|
| Low (1-4) | Accept with documented rationale | RMS Owner |
| Medium (5-9) | Mitigate to Low OR accept with senior approval | Head of Compliance |
| High (10-16) | Mandatory mitigation; acceptance requires executive approval and legal review | C-Suite + Legal Counsel |
| Critical (17-25) | Do not deploy until mitigated; if not mitigable, consult competent authority | Board + Competent Authority |

### 4.2 Risk Evaluation Decisions

For each risk assessed as Medium or above, document the evaluation decision:

| Risk ID | Inherent Risk Level | Evaluation Decision | Rationale | Approver | Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | ☐ Accept ☐ Mitigate ☐ Transfer ☐ Avoid | | | |
| | | ☐ Accept ☐ Mitigate ☐ Transfer ☐ Avoid | | | |
| | | ☐ Accept ☐ Mitigate ☐ Transfer ☐ Avoid | | | |
| | | ☐ Accept ☐ Mitigate ☐ Transfer ☐ Avoid | | | |
| | | ☐ Accept ☐ Mitigate ☐ Transfer ☐ Avoid | | | |

## Part 5: Step 4: Risk Treatment Measures

**Article 9(2)(c)** requires adoption of appropriate risk management measures. **Article 9(3)** specifies that where feasible, technical measures should be addressed during design and development before information and training measures.

**Treatment measure hierarchy (Article 9(3)):**
1. Technical measures first (design, architecture, training, testing)
2. Operational measures second (deployment constraints, instructions for use)
3. Training and information measures third (operator training, transparency)

### 5.1 Risk Treatment Plans

For each risk requiring treatment, complete a treatment plan:

#### Treatment Plan Template

**Risk ID:** ___________
**Risk Description:** _______________________________________________
**Current Risk Score:** ___________  **Target Residual Score:** ___________

| # | Treatment Measure | Type | Implementation Owner | Target Completion | Verification Method | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | ☐ Technical ☐ Operational ☐ Training | | | | ☐ Open ☐ In Progress ☐ Complete |
| 2 | | ☐ Technical ☐ Operational ☐ Training | | | | ☐ Open ☐ In Progress ☐ Complete |
| 3 | | ☐ Technical ☐ Operational ☐ Training | | | | ☐ Open ☐ In Progress ☐ Complete |

**Residual risk score after treatment:** ___________
**Residual risk level:** ☐ Low ☐ Medium ☐ High ☐ Critical
