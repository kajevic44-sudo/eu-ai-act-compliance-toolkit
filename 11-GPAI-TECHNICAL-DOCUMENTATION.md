# 11: GPAI Model Technical Documentation Template (Annex XI / Annex XII)

**EU AI Act Reference:** Articles 53-55 | Annex XI | Annex XII | Article 51 (Systemic Risk)
**Applies to:** Providers of General-Purpose AI (GPAI) Models
**Retention Period:** Keep up to date throughout model lifecycle; available to EU AI Office on request
**Last Updated:** April 2026

---

## Purpose

Articles 53-55 impose a distinct set of obligations on providers of **General-Purpose AI (GPAI) models:** foundation models, large language models, and multimodal models that can be used for a wide range of downstream tasks. These obligations differ substantially from high-risk AI system requirements under Annex IV and require separate documentation under **Annex XI** (standard GPAI) and **Annex XII** (systemic risk GPAI).

This template covers both tiers. Complete Part A for all GPAI models. Complete Part B additionally if your model meets the systemic risk threshold (Article 51: >10²⁵ FLOPs training compute, or designated by EU AI Office).

> **Tip:** the EU AI Office's [GPAI Code of Practice](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/contents-code-gpai) is the endorsed way to show compliance with Article 53 (Transparency and Copyright chapters) and Article 55 (Safety and Security chapter). You can also draft the model card itself on the [AI Model Card Whiteboard](https://ai-modelcard-whiteboard.lovable.app).
