# 24: Worked Example: Credit Scoring AI System

**EU AI Act Reference:** Article 6(2) | Annex III Area 5 (Access to and enjoyment of essential private services and public services and benefits) | Articles 9-17 | Article 27 | Article 43-47
**Applies to:** This worked example; providers and deployers of AI systems used in consumer credit assessment
**Last Updated:** April 2026

## Purpose

This worked example demonstrates how to apply the full EU AI Act Compliance Toolkit to a credit scoring AI system, a system that falls squarely within Annex III Area 5 of the EU AI Act (high-risk AI used in access to private services, specifically creditworthiness assessment).

It complements the existing HR Screening System worked example (WORKED-EXAMPLE-HR-SCREENING-SYSTEM.md), providing a second end-to-end illustration covering a different high-risk category and a deployer-provider split scenario.

**Note:** This is a fictional worked example for training and illustration purposes. Names, data, and specifics are fictional.

## Part 1: System Description

### 1.1 Scenario

**Organisation:** RetailBank NV, a mid-sized retail bank operating in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany.

**System Name:** CreditScore-AI v2.3

**System Provider:** FinTech Solutions BV (a Netherlands-based AI company)

**Deployer:** RetailBank NV

**Purpose:** CreditScore-AI v2.3 is a machine learning model that assesses the creditworthiness of individual applicants for personal loans between €1,000 and €50,000. It generates a credit risk score (0-1,000) and a decision recommendation (Approve / Refer for human review / Decline). Human loan officers make all final lending decisions; the system does not autonomously approve or decline applications.

**Technology:** Gradient boosted decision tree model (LightGBM); trained on 5 years of RetailBank NV historical loan data; 47 input features.

**Deployment context:** Web and mobile loan application portal; also accessible to branch advisors.

## Part 2: Step 1: Risk Classification

**Reference: 01-RISK-CLASSIFICATION-GUIDE.md**

### 2.1 Is CreditScore-AI an AI System Under Article 3(1)?

| Test | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Machine-based system? | Yes, LightGBM model |
| Infers from input to produce outputs (predictions, decisions, recommendations)? | Yes, outputs credit score and decision recommendation |
| Can influence real-world environments? | Yes, loan decisions affect individuals' access to credit |

**Conclusion: CreditScore-AI is an AI system under Article 3(1).** ✓

### 2.2 Check Against Article 5: Prohibited Practices

| Prohibited Practice | Applicable? |
|---|---|
| Subliminal manipulation (Art. 5(1)(a)) | No |
| Exploitation of vulnerability (Art. 5(1)(b)) | No, but DPA guidance on vulnerable customers should be consulted |
| Social scoring by public authorities (Art. 5(1)(c)) | No, private lender |
| Real-time remote biometric identification (Art. 5(2)) | No |
| Biometric categorisation for inferences (Art. 5(1)(d)) | No |

**Conclusion: No prohibited practices. Proceed to Annex III assessment.** ✓

### 2.3 Annex III High-Risk Assessment

| Annex III Area | Description | Applicable? |
|---|---|---|
| Area 1, Biometrics | | No |
| Area 2, Critical infrastructure | | No |
| Area 3, Education | | No |
| Area 4, Employment | | No |
| **Area 5, Access to private services** | AI used in creditworthiness assessment and credit scoring of natural persons | **YES** |
| Area 6, Law enforcement | | No |
| Area 7, Migration | | No |
| Area 8, Administration of justice | | No |

**Annex III, Area 5, Item (b):** "AI systems intended to be used for the purpose of making decisions, or materially influencing decisions, on the creditworthiness of natural persons or on their access to or enjoyment of essential private services."

**Conclusion: CreditScore-AI is HIGH-RISK under Annex III Area 5(b).** ✓

### 2.4 Article 6(3) Exclusion Assessment

Article 6(3) permits exclusion from high-risk treatment if the AI system does not pose a significant risk. The deployer (RetailBank NV) has assessed:

- The system materially influences credit decisions affecting individuals' access to essential services
- Loan decisions have significant financial and social consequences for individuals
- No Article 6(3) exclusion applies

**Conclusion: Article 6(3) exclusion NOT applicable. Full Chapter III obligations apply.** ✓

## Part 4: Step 3: Risk Management System

**Reference: 02-CONFORMITY-ASSESSMENT-CHECKLIST.md (Section A) | 04-TECHNICAL-DOCUMENTATION-TEMPLATE.md (Section 4)**

### 4.1 Key Risks Identified (Article 9)

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Likelihood | Severity | Residual Risk | Mitigation |

| R-001 | Model underperforms for underrepresented demographic groups → disparate impact in lending | Medium | High | Medium | Bias audit; fairness thresholds; human review escalation for borderline cases |
| R-002 | Input data quality from applicant is poor or fraudulent → incorrect credit score | Medium | High | Low | Input validation; fraud detection layer; human oversight required for all Decline recommendations |
| R-003 | Model drift as economic conditions change → predictions become less accurate | Medium | Medium | Low | Monthly accuracy monitoring; quarterly recalibration review |
| R-004 | Automation bias, loan officers over-rely on score, rubber-stamping decisions | Medium | High | Medium | Training programme; decision record requires officer to document independent assessment |
| R-005 | Adversarial gaming by applicants who manipulate inputs | Low | Medium | Low | Feature engineering to reduce gameable features; anomaly detection |
| R-006 | Data breach, applicant personal data including financial data | Low | High | Low | ISO 27001 controls; encryption at rest and in transit; access controls |

### 4.2 Risk Management Process

The risk management system is iterative (Art. 9(1)):
- **Pre-deployment:** Full risk assessment before each major release
- **Quarterly:** PMM data review triggering risk register update if performance thresholds crossed
- **Annually:** Full risk management system review by AI Governance Committee
- **Event-triggered:** Immediate review upon serious incident or MSA inquiry

## Lessons Learned (For Training Purposes)

| Issue | Lesson |
|---|---|
| Regional proxy variable bias initially overlooked | Always test proxies for protected characteristics, not just direct features |
| Art. 22 GDPR / Art. 14 AI Act interface | Human review must be genuinely meaningful, rubber stamping fails both regimes |
| DPIA and FRIA overlap | For credit scoring by a private lender, DPIA required; FRIA is voluntary (not a public body), but many elements overlap |
| Deployer's Art. 26(7) obligation | Often overlooked, RetailBank NV must inform loan officer staff before system deployment |
| EU database registration timing | Registration must occur before market placement, not after go-live |
