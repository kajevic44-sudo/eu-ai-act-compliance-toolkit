# Changelog

All notable changes to the EU AI Act Compliance Toolkit are documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Toolkit versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
Regulatory baseline: Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 as entered into force 1 August 2024. This toolkit will be updated as delegated acts, implementing acts, and EU AI Office guidance documents are published.

---

## [3.4.0] - 2026-06-28

### Changed (companion tools and formatting)

**Companion tools.** Added a "Companion tools (live)" section to the README and contextual links throughout, so users can move from a template to a live app: the AI Model Card Whiteboard (Docs 04, 06, 11), the AI Compliance Compass (Docs 16, 18, 19), and the ISO 42001 AI Governance Toolkit (Doc 16). QUICKSTART and INDEX point to the same set.

**Formatting and tone.** Removed em-dashes and en-dashes across the whole toolkit in favour of commas, colons and hyphens, and replaced the multiplication sign with "x", so the writing reads as plain, human-edited prose. Wording, statutory references, figures and deadlines were left unchanged.

---

## [3.3.0] - 2026-06-28

### Changed (currency update: official EU guidance)

This release aligns the toolkit with official EU developments published after the Act's staged entry into application. No statutory templates were rewritten; references and orientation material were updated so users are pointed to the current, authoritative Commission and AI Office guidance.

**README.md:** Bumped to v3.3.0. Added a new **"Recent Official Guidance & Developments"** section summarising, with primary-source links: the Commission's February 2025 Guidelines on prohibited AI practices and Guidelines on the AI system definition; the **General-Purpose AI Code of Practice** (published 10 July 2025) and its three chapters, Transparency and Copyright (demonstrating Art. 53 compliance for all GPAI providers) and Safety & Security (Art. 55, GPAI with systemic risk); the applicability of GPAI obligations, governance and penalties from 2 August 2025; and the June 2026 Code of Practice on marking and labelling AI-generated content (Art. 50). Clarified the timeline so that 2 August 2026 covers Annex III high-risk systems (Art. 6(2)) while Art. 6(1) Annex I product-embedded systems apply from 2 August 2027, and added the 2 August 2030 legacy public-authority date. Cross-referenced Docs 06, 11, 25 and 27 to the relevant guidance, expanded "Related Resources" into Primary EU sources and Standards, and noted the classifier is now v2.2.

**docs/QUICKSTART.md:** Added Section 8 "Official guidance you can rely on" pointing newcomers to the Commission's free guidance (prohibited-practices and AI-system-definition guidelines, the GPAI Code of Practice, the AI-generated-content labelling Code, and the AI Pact / AI Act Service Desk). Extended the deadlines table to include Art. 50 transparency (2 Aug 2026), Art. 6(1) Annex I systems (2 Aug 2027) and legacy public-authority systems (2 Aug 2030).

**docs/INDEX.md:** Added an "Official EU guidance these documents align to" section mapping each piece of Commission guidance to the specific toolkit documents it supports.

### Verified against primary sources

Statutory facts and dates in this release were checked against EUR-Lex (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, CELEX:32024R1689) and the European Commission's AI Act pages (digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu), including the implementation timeline and the General-Purpose AI Code of Practice page. The Commission guidance referenced is interpretive; the binding text remains the Regulation.

---

## [3.2.1] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed (regulatory accuracy)

This patch release corrects a set of statutory references and timelines identified in an expert review. No new documents were added; existing documents were corrected.

**08-INCIDENT-REPORTING-PROCEDURE.md:** Corrected the Article 73 serious-incident reporting deadlines. The Act does **not** use a single 72-hour deadline. Article 73(2)-(4) sets tiered deadlines from awareness: immediately and in any event **15 days** (general), **2 days** (widespread infringement / serious incident disrupting critical infrastructure, Art. 3(49)(b)), and **10 days** (death of a person). The 72-hour figure is the GDPR Art. 33 personal-data-breach deadline and was removed from the AI Act context. Aligned the Art. 3(49) serious-incident categories with the enacted text.

**18-GDPR-AI-ACT-INTERSECTION.md:** Corrected Part 8.2 dual incident reporting to show the AI Act (Art. 73 tiers) and GDPR (Art. 33, 72h) clocks as separate regimes. Added the Article 86 right to explanation of individual decision-making and Art. 26(11) deployer information to affected persons. Clarified the Art. 10(5) special-category-data pathway for bias detection and Art. 27(4) DPIA/FRIA complementarity. Corrected the GDPR-complementarity recital to Recital 10.

**25-PROHIBITED-PRACTICES-ASSESSMENT.md:** Corrected the Article 5(1) sub-letters to the enacted text: predictive policing based on profiling = **(d)**; untargeted facial-image scraping = **(e)**; emotion recognition in workplace/education = **(f)**; biometric categorisation by protected characteristics = **(g)**; real-time remote biometric identification = **(h)**. Removed the "public authorities only" limitation from social scoring (c). Re-pointed RBI exemptions to Art. 5(1)(h)(i)-(iii) with the Annex II 4-year custodial threshold and the 24-hour urgent-authorisation rule. Corrected the recital range to 28-45.

**27-GPAI-SYSTEMIC-RISK-COMPLIANCE.md:** Corrected the Article 55(1) sub-letter mapping: (a) model evaluation/adversarial testing, (b) systemic-risk assessment & mitigation, (c) serious-incident reporting to the AI Office "without undue delay", (d) **cybersecurity**. Removed the incorrect "Art. 55(1)(d) = EU AI Office cooperation / energy efficiency" labels. Re-pointed the AI Office/Commission investigatory and corrective powers from Article 56 (Codes of practice) to the correct enforcement articles **88, 91, 92, 93**, and added the Article 101 GPAI penalty regime (3% / €15m). Replaced "≤ 72 hours" GPAI timelines with the statutory "without undue delay".

**01-RISK-CLASSIFICATION-GUIDE.md:** Corrected the Article 5 prohibited-practice sub-letters in Step 2. Added the Article 6(3) profiling override (an Annex III system performing profiling of natural persons is always high-risk) and the Article 49(2) requirement to register a 6(3)-excluded system in the EU database. Clarified that Article 50 transparency is an overlay that also applies to high-risk and excluded systems. Updated FRIA scoping for the credit/insurance mandatory cases.

**02-CONFORMITY-ASSESSMENT-CHECKLIST.md:** Added Section 0 on the Article 43 conformity assessment route (Annex VI internal control vs Annex VII Notified Body vs sectoral Annex I legislation). Corrected the sign-off: Article 22 designates the **Authorised Representative** for non-EU providers, not a generic internal "responsible person". Strengthened the Art. 15 cybersecurity row with named adversarial-ML threats; added Art. 14(5) two-person biometric verification and Art. 12(3) biometric logging items.

**README.md:** Moved GPAI out of the "Limited Risk" tier into its own separate-regime row (Arts. 51-56). Split the high-risk timeline into Annex III (2 Aug 2026) and Annex I product-embedded systems (2 Aug 2027) and added the legacy-GPAI deadline. Updated script references to v2.1/v2.2 with the new `--format json|csv` output and CI gate. Corrected Doc 27 (Arts. 88-94) and Doc 25 (Recitals 28-45) references. Added a prominent QUICKSTART link and a NIST AI RMF resource link.

**scripts/risk_classifier.py:** Upgraded to **v2.2**. GPAI obligations (Arts. 53-55) are now appended **in addition** to the system risk tier, fixing a bug where a GPAI model embedded in a high-risk system silently lost its GPAI obligations. Added a `gpai_systemic` CSV flag (Art. 55) and an Art. 6(3) profiling override. Corrected the HIGH/LIMITED obligations lists and added the Art. 49(2) exclusion-registration reminder.

**docs/QUICKSTART.md:** New plain-language, 10-minute orientation for newcomers: what the Act is, role-based "hats", the four tiers plus the GPAI regime, the real deadlines, the first three steps, the GDPR interplay, and the penalty bands. Linked from the README and Doc 01.

---

## [3.2.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

**25-PROHIBITED-PRACTICES-ASSESSMENT.md:** New standalone Article 5 Prohibited Practices Assessment Checklist. Closes a critical coverage gap: the eight prohibited practices have been enforceable since 2 February 2025 and carry the highest fines in the Regulation (up to €35 million / 7% of global turnover). Covers: preliminary scoping questions; individual assessments for all eight prohibitions (subliminal techniques, vulnerable group exploitation, social scoring by public authorities, real-time remote biometric identification, biometric categorisation by protected characteristics, emotion recognition in workplace/education, untargeted facial image scraping, and predictive individual criminal profiling); exemption tests for Prohibitions 4 and 6; scope boundary notes distinguishing prohibited from high-risk; clearance certificate with four-party sign-off; and post-clearance obligations table linking to Doc 01.

**26-RISK-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM.md:** New standalone Article 9 Risk Management System template. Article 9 is one of the most frequently audited requirements for high-risk AI systems but was previously covered only partially within Doc 02 (Conformity Assessment) and Doc 04 (Technical Documentation). This document provides a complete, standalone RMS framework distinct from the QMS (Article 17, Doc 16). Covers: RMS governance structure and scope; Step 1, risk identification across six categories (technical performance, data and bias, human oversight, security/adversarial, fundamental rights, operational) plus reasonably foreseeable misuse; Step 2, risk estimation with likelihood/severity/breadth scales and risk register; Step 3, risk evaluation against acceptable thresholds (four-level policy with approval requirements); Step 4, risk treatment plans by category with standard treatment measures library; Step 5, residual risk assessment and acceptance with aggregate sign-off; Step 6, testing and validation including pre-market testing, bias testing by protected characteristic, and performance threshold table; Step 7, post-market monitoring integration with update triggers and RMS update log; and Article 9 completeness checklist with Annex IV cross-reference map.

**27-GPAI-SYSTEMIC-RISK-COMPLIANCE.md:** New GPAI Systemic Risk Compliance Guide for Articles 55-56. Supplements Doc 11 (GPAI baseline obligations) with the additional obligations triggered when a GPAI model meets the systemic risk threshold (≥ 10²⁵ FLOPs or EU AI Office designation). Covers: systemic risk classification determination; rebuttable presumption process; Obligation 1, adversarial testing/red-teaming with eight risk domain coverage checklist (CBRN uplift, cyberoffensive capabilities, critical infrastructure attack, disinformation at scale, autonomous harmful action, safety bypass, bias at scale, privacy violation at scale) and findings register; Obligation 2, enhanced incident reporting with systemic risk incident categories and timelines (including parallel GDPR/AI Act reporting for personal data breach); Obligation 3, cybersecurity measures including risk assessment table and 10-control minimum standard; Obligation 4, EU AI Office cooperation including five-step internal response process; Article 56 powers awareness checklist; post-training risk mitigation measures register (six measure types); downstream provider management controls; annual review governance; and voluntary codes of practice participation tracker.

**28-MARKET-SURVEILLANCE-RESPONSE.md:** New Market Surveillance and Regulatory Response Procedure. Addresses the practical "what happens when the regulator comes knocking" gap that existing toolkit documents did not cover. Covers: regulatory landscape (national MSAs, EU AI Office, DPAs, sectoral regulators) with competent authority contact register; comprehensive document retention schedule (12 document types with Article-specific retention periods, including the critical 10-year obligation for technical documentation and QMS records); deployer-specific retention obligations; annual document retention audit; regulatory readiness assessment with 16-item self-assessment across three categories; five-step first response protocol (Day 0 authentication through sign-off); on-site inspection protocol with guidance on cooperation, note-taking, and rights; regulatory interaction log template; corrective action response procedure; Article 99 administrative fines reference table (€35m/7%; €15m/3%; €7.5m/1.5%); appeals and judicial remedies overview; and 15-item enforcement readiness checklist with scoring.

### Changed

**README.md:** Updated to v3.2.0. Added Docs 25-28 to document table. Updated routing table to include new "Preparing for market surveillance inspection" row and updated all relevant rows to include Doc 25 (prohibited practices) as Step 1 for all providers and deployers. Updated "How to Use" section: added Step 1 (prohibited practices screen) before risk classification, added RMS step for high-risk providers, added market surveillance preparation to ongoing processes. Added RMS and MSA to Key Definitions.

**18-GDPR-AI-ACT-INTERSECTION.md:** Corrected a material error in Section 2.1 (Data Governance Joint Compliance Map): GDPR Art. 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality / security) was incorrectly mapped to the "bias examined" row. Corrected to Art. 5(1)(d) (accuracy) + Recital 71 GDPR (non-discrimination in profiling) for the bias row. Added a separate row for data integrity/security correctly mapped to Art. 5(1)(f). Updated bias audit reference in the joint compliance checklist to "Arts. 5(1)(d), 9; Recital 71".

**19-MASTER-COMPLIANCE-SCORECARD.md:** Corrected item count arithmetic: the scorecard contained 118 checkable requirements across 11 sections (not 100 as previously stated in Part 14). Updated summary table totals to show accurate section counts (Part 3: 10; Part 4: 35; Part 5: 12; Part 6: 8; Part 7: 6; Part 8: 4; Part 9: 8; Part 10: 7; Part 11: 5; Part 12: 5; Part 13: 8; Total: 118).

**20-NOTIFIED-BODY-ENGAGEMENT-GUIDE.md:** Corrected imprecise Article reference in Section 1.2, Circumstance 2: "Article 5(1)(h)" was cited for real-time remote biometric identification systems. Per the enacted Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, the conditions and derogations for real-time remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement are in Article 5(2)-(7). Updated to cite "Article 5(2)-(7)" with contextual explanation.
