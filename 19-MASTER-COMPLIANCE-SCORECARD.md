# 19: Master Compliance Scorecard

**EU AI Act Reference:** All Articles
**Applies to:** All organisations providing or deploying AI systems in the EU
**Last Updated:** April 2026

## Purpose

This Master Compliance Scorecard provides a single consolidated view of your organisation's EU AI Act compliance position across all 20 toolkit documents. Use it to:
- Conduct an initial gap analysis before building your compliance programme
- Track progress as you implement each requirement
- Present compliance status to senior leadership and the board
- Prepare for regulatory review or audit
- Identify priority actions based on risk tier and compliance deadline

**How to use:** Complete the scorecard for each AI system in scope. Systems at different risk tiers will have different applicable requirements, the scorecard identifies N/A items automatically via the tier columns.
