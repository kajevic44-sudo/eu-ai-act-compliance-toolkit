# 20: Notified Body Engagement Guide

**EU AI Act Reference:** Article 43 | Article 44 | Article 45 | Article 46 | Annex VII
**Applies to:** Providers of High-Risk AI Systems requiring third-party conformity assessment
**Last Updated:** April 2026

## Purpose

Most high-risk AI systems under the EU AI Act allow providers to self-certify via an internal conformity assessment (Annex VI). However, certain categories require involvement of a Notified Body, an independent third-party assessment organisation accredited by a national accreditation body. This guide explains when a Notified Body is required, how to find and select one, how to prepare for the assessment, and how to manage the ongoing relationship.

## Part 1: When Is a Notified Body Required?

### 1.1 The Default Rule: Internal Conformity Assessment

For most Annex III high-risk AI systems, Article 43(2) permits providers to conduct an internal conformity assessment (Annex VI procedure) without involving a Notified Body. This requires the provider to:
- Verify the system complies with all Chapter III Section 2 requirements (Articles 9-15, 17)
- Maintain technical documentation
- Draw up the EU Declaration of Conformity

### 1.2 When a Notified Body Is Mandatory

A Notified Body is required in two specific circumstances:

**Circumstance 1, Annex I Product Safety Components (Article 43(1))**

Where a high-risk AI system is a safety component of, or is itself, a product covered by Annex I EU harmonisation legislation, AND that legislation requires third-party conformity assessment, the AI Act conformity assessment must also be carried out by a Notified Body.

Relevant Annex I legislation typically requiring NB involvement:
- Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) (EU) 2017/745, Class IIa and above
- In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Regulation (IVDR) (EU) 2017/746, Class B and above
- Machinery Regulation (EU) 2023/1230, Annex IV machinery
- Radio Equipment Directive 2014/53/EU, certain categories

**Circumstance 2, Real-Time Remote Biometric Identification Systems (Article 43(1)(b))**

Where a high-risk AI system is intended for use as a real-time remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces, Notified Body involvement is required under Article 43(1)(b).

Under the enacted EU AI Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689), the use of real-time remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes is addressed in **Article 5(2)-(7)**, which sets out the conditions, safeguards, and derogations under which such use may exceptionally be permitted. Systems falling within Article 5(2) derogations that are deployed as high-risk systems under Annex III Area 1 still require Notified Body assessment where Article 43(1)(b) applies.

> **Note:** The biometric categorisation systems listed in Annex III Area 1 that are NOT real-time remote biometric identification systems may still be assessed via internal conformity assessment (Annex VI).

### 1.3 Summary Decision Table

| AI System Type | Notified Body Required? | Assessment Procedure |
|---|---|---|
| Annex III high-risk, standalone software (e.g. HR AI, credit scoring) | No | Internal, Annex VI |
| Annex III high-risk, safety component of Annex I product with mandatory NB | Yes | Annex VII (NB) |
| Medical device AI, Class I | No (unless AI Act Art. 43(1)(b) applies) | Internal, Annex VI |
| Medical device AI, Class IIa and above (MDR) | Yes (MDR NB required) | MDR NB + Annex VII AI Act |
| Real-time remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces (Art. 43(1)(b)) | Yes | Annex VII (NB) |
| GPAI model only (no high-risk AI system) | No | N/A, Articles 53-56 apply |

## Part 2: Understanding the Notified Body Role

### 2.1 What a Notified Body Does

Under Article 44 and Annex VII, a Notified Body assesses whether the high-risk AI system meets all applicable requirements. The NB:
- Reviews technical documentation
- Assesses the risk management system
- Evaluates data governance and bias assessment methodology
- Reviews logging, transparency, human oversight, and accuracy provisions
- Issues a certificate of conformity if requirements are met
- Monitors ongoing compliance through surveillance activities

### 2.2 What a Notified Body Does NOT Do

- Does not provide compliance consultancy or tell the provider how to fix non-conformances before assessment (conflict of interest restriction)
- Does not guarantee commercial success or fitness for purpose beyond regulatory requirements
- Does not replace internal QMS or ongoing post-market monitoring obligations
- Does not assess GDPR compliance (separate DPA jurisdiction)

### 2.3 Notified Body Independence Requirements (Article 44)

Notified Bodies must be:
- Independent of the providers and systems they assess
- Free from any commercial, financial, or other pressure that could compromise their objectivity
- Accredited by a National Accreditation Body (NAB) designated by an EU Member State
- Listed in the NANDO database (European Commission database of Notified Bodies)

---

## Part 3: Finding a Notified Body

### 3.1 NANDO Database

The primary source for finding accredited Notified Bodies is the NANDO (New Approach Notified and Designated Organisations) database maintained by the European Commission:

**NANDO Database:** https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/nando/

Search filters to use:
- **Directive / Regulation:** Select the relevant legislation (EU AI Act once operational; or MDR / Machinery for Annex I products)
- **Country:** Select EU Member State where NB is established
- **Product code:** Use relevant product classification codes

### 3.2 EU AI Act Specific Notified Bodies

> **Note:** As of April 2026, the Notified Body designation process under the EU AI Act is still maturing. Many existing NBs designated under Annex I product legislation (MDR, Machinery) are expected to seek designation under the AI Act.

Monitor:
- NANDO database for newly designated AI Act NBs
- EU AI Office announcements: https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-office
- National Accreditation Body announcements in your jurisdiction

### 3.3 Criteria for Selecting a Notified Body

Evaluate potential NBs against these criteria:

| Criterion | What to Assess |
|---|---|
| Designation scope | Confirmed designation covers your system type and Annex III category |
| Technical expertise | NB has assessors with relevant AI / ML expertise in your application domain (healthcare, employment, etc.) |
| Sector experience | Prior experience with similar systems in your industry vertical |
| Capacity and timeline | Can accommodate your target assessment timeline; no excessive queue times |
| Geographic presence | Accessible for on-site activities; familiar with relevant national regulations |
| Language | Can conduct assessment in your working language |
| Fee structure | Transparent, proportionate to system complexity |
| References | Can provide client references for comparable assessments |

## Part 5: The Assessment Process (Annex VII)

### 5.1 Assessment Phases

| Phase | Description | Typical Duration | Your Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1: Contract and scoping | Sign engagement agreement; agree scope, timeline, fees | 1-2 weeks | Provide system overview; confirm scope; agree access |
| Phase 2: Document review | NB reviews technical documentation package | 4-8 weeks | Respond to information requests promptly |
| Phase 3: Product assessment | NB technical experts assess the AI system itself; may include testing | 4-8 weeks | Provide system access; support testing activities |
| Phase 4: Findings and non-conformances | NB issues preliminary findings; provider addresses non-conformances | 2-6 weeks | Remediate findings; provide evidence of corrections |
| Phase 5: Certificate decision | NB issues certificate of conformity or declines | 1-2 weeks |, |
| Phase 6: Certificate issuance | Certificate issued; valid for defined period (typically 3-5 years) |, | Update DoC, register, technical docs to reference certificate |

**Total typical timeline:** 3-6 months for a straightforward system. Complex systems, significant non-conformances, or NB capacity constraints can extend this materially. Plan your compliance timeline accordingly.

### 5.2 Types of NB Findings

| Finding Type | Description | Provider Action Required |
|---|---|---|
| Observation | Minor gap; improvement recommended but does not block certificate | Document response; address in next review |
| Minor non-conformance | Gap that can be remediated before certificate issuance | Remediate within agreed timeframe; submit evidence |
| Major non-conformance | Significant gap; certificate cannot be issued until resolved | Full remediation required; may trigger re-assessment |
| Critical finding | System does not meet fundamental requirements | Significant rework; new assessment cycle |

### 5.3 If the NB Declines to Issue a Certificate

If a Notified Body concludes the system does not meet requirements:
- Request a detailed written explanation of all non-conformances
- Assess whether findings are correct or whether you wish to appeal
- If correct: implement remediation and request re-assessment
- If disputing: engage the appeals process (each NB must have a defined appeals mechanism per Article 44(10))

> **Note:** A declined certificate does not automatically require notification to authorities, but the system cannot be placed on the market until conformity is achieved.

## Part 6: Certificate Maintenance and Surveillance

### 6.1 Certificate Validity and Renewal

| Item | Typical Requirement |
|---|---|
| Certificate validity period | 3-5 years (varies by NB and regulation) |
| Renewal process | Re-application and assessment before expiry |
| Surveillance visits | Periodic unannounced or scheduled surveillance (often annual) |
| Change notification | Provider must notify NB of any substantial modifications |

### 6.2 Ongoing NB Notification Obligations

Once a certificate is in place, providers must notify the Notified Body of:

| Event | Notification Required? | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| Substantial modification to the AI system (Article 25) | Yes | Before implementing change |
| Change to intended purpose | Yes | Before implementing change |
| Serious incident involving the system | Yes (if NB was involved in assessment) | Without undue delay |
| Change of provider name or address | Yes | Within reasonable time |
| Provider becomes aware of non-conformance | Yes | Without undue delay |

### 6.3 Certificate Register

Maintain a register of all active NB certificates:

| Certificate Number | NB Name | AI System | Issue Date | Expiry Date | Surveillance Due | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | | Active / Expired |

---

## Part 7: Costs and Timeline Planning

### 7.1 Cost Drivers for NB Assessment

NB assessment costs vary significantly based on:

| Factor | Lower Cost | Higher Cost |
|---|---|---|
| System complexity | Simple single-purpose system | Complex multi-component system with multiple use cases |
| Documentation readiness | Well-prepared documentation package | Incomplete docs requiring extensive NB review |
| Non-conformances | No or minor findings | Major findings requiring rework and re-assessment |
| System type | Standard AI software | Medical device AI or safety-critical system |
| NB experience | NB with prior AI Act assessment experience | First-time AI Act NB (learning curve) |
| Surveillance requirements | Annual desk-based surveillance | Frequent on-site surveillance |

**Indicative ranges** (highly variable; confirm with NB): Initial assessments for straightforward Annex III systems may range from EUR 15,000 to EUR 100,000+. Medical device AI NB assessments are typically higher. Request detailed fee proposals from at least two NBs.

### 7.2 Timeline Planning

Working backwards from your target market placement date:

| Milestone | Lead Time Before Market Placement |
|---|---|
| NB certificate received | At least 4 weeks before placement (DoC update, registration) |
| NB assessment complete (no major findings) | 3-6 months before target placement date |
| Documentation package submitted to NB | 4-8 months before target placement |
| NB selected and engaged | 5-9 months before target placement |
| Internal conformity assessment complete | 6-10 months before target placement |
| Technical documentation complete | 7-11 months before target placement |
| System development complete and tested | 8-12 months before target placement |

**Recommended approach:** Engage a Notified Body early, even before internal assessment is complete, to understand their requirements, queue times, and documentation expectations. Many NBs offer pre-assessment consultations or scoping meetings.

## Part 8: Interaction with Other EU Legislation NBs

Where an AI system is a component of a product regulated under Annex I legislation, the NB assessment may be combined or coordinated:

| Scenario | Approach |
|---|---|
| AI system is a medical device (MDR), Class IIa+ | Single NB preferred; NB must be designated under both MDR and EU AI Act. Article 11(3) permits combined technical documentation. |
| AI system in machinery (Machinery Regulation Annex IV) | Coordinate with MDR NB or separate Machinery NB; confirm dual designation |
| AI system in radio equipment (RED) | RED NB + AI Act NB; combined assessment if NB holds dual designation |
| Single combined certificate possible? | Only if NB holds designation under all applicable legislation; confirm with specific NB |
