# 03: Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA)

**EU AI Act Reference:** Article 27
**Applies to:** Deployers of High-Risk AI Systems (in the public sector or private bodies providing public services)
**Mandatory for:** Bodies governed by public law; private operators providing public services (banking, insurance, healthcare, education)
**Last Updated:** April 2026

## Purpose

Article 27 requires certain deployers of high-risk AI systems to carry out a Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA) before deploying the system. This template provides a structured approach to identifying and mitigating potential impacts on fundamental rights protected under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
