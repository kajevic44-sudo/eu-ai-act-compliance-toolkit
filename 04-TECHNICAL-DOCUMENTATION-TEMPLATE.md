# 04: Technical Documentation Template (Annex IV)

**EU AI Act Reference:** Article 11 | Annex IV
**Applies to:** Providers of High-Risk AI Systems
**Retention Period:** 10 years after last placement on market (Article 18)

## Annex IV, Section 8: Post-Market Monitoring

Article 72 of the EU AI Act requires providers of high-risk AI systems to establish a post-market monitoring system proportionate to the nature of the AI technology and its risks. This section of the technical documentation must describe that system.

The full Post-Market Monitoring Plan is maintained separately as **09-POST-MARKET-MONITORING-PLAN.md**. This section provides the Annex IV summary required within the technical documentation record.

| Last Updated | |

### 8.2 Performance Monitoring Approach

Describe how the system's performance is monitored after market placement:

| Monitoring Activity | Method | Frequency | Owner | Threshold / Alert Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Model accuracy monitoring | Automated metric tracking | [e.g. Monthly] | | [e.g. accuracy drops below declared threshold] |
| Bias and fairness monitoring | Demographic parity re-assessment | [e.g. Quarterly] | | [e.g. >5% disparity vs. baseline] |
| Input data distribution monitoring | Statistical drift detection | [e.g. Monthly] | | [e.g. KS test p < 0.05] |
| Deployer feedback collection | Structured feedback forms | [e.g. Quarterly] | | Any reported issue triggering review |
| User complaint monitoring | Complaint register review | [e.g. Monthly] | | Any complaint involving safety or discrimination |

### 8.3 Data Collection from Deployers (Article 72(3))

Providers must collect and review relevant data from deployers to evaluate whether the system continues to meet requirements. Document the data collection mechanism:

| Data Type | Collection Method | Frequency | Storage Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| System performance logs | Automated log export / deployer submission | | |
| Incidents and near-misses | Deployer incident reports (Doc 08) | | |
| User feedback and complaints | Deployer feedback forms | | |
| Environmental / contextual changes | Deployer questionnaire | | |

### 8.4 Trigger Criteria for Reactive Review

A reactive review of the AI system's performance must be triggered upon any of the following:

| Trigger | Action Required |
|---|---|
| Performance falls below declared accuracy threshold | Immediate investigation; consider market withdrawal pending review |
| Serious incident reported under Article 73 | Initiate full PMM-driven investigation |
| Deployer reports unexpected behaviour | Log; assess within 10 working days |
| Regulatory authority request for investigation | Respond within required timeline; provide PMM data |
| Substantial modification contemplated (Article 25) | PMM data review as part of modification assessment |
| New information on risks to health, safety, fundamental rights | Unscheduled review; update risk management system |

### 8.5 Corrective Actions

If PMM identifies that the system no longer meets requirements, the provider must:

1. **Classify severity:** minor, moderate, or critical
2. **Notify deployers:** provide guidance without undue delay
3. **Assess notifiable incident:** determine if Article 73 serious incident reporting applies
4. **Implement corrective action:** software update, additional instructions, or market withdrawal
5. **Update documentation:** revise technical documentation, risk register, and instructions for use
6. **Assess substantial modification:** determine if a new conformity assessment is required under Article 25

### 8.6 PMM Record-Keeping

| Record Type | Retention Period | Location |
|---|---|---|
| PMM reports (annual and triggered) | 10 years from last placement | |
| Monitoring data summaries | 10 years from last placement | |
| Corrective action records | 10 years from last placement | |
| Deployer feedback records | 10 years from last placement | |

> **Note:** Article 18 requires technical documentation to be retained for 10 years after the AI system is last placed on the market. PMM records form part of this retention obligation.
